    <h1>I will get my 2% today!</h1>
    <p>Start investing your 2% right now! Letâ€™s do it with baby steps. For example, if you work in an office start going out during your lunch breaks and walk a couple of blocks around the office building. Why not try parking your car far from your office and walk to the office! Well maybe instead of your car you can use your bike when you commute between your office and home next time.</p>
    <p> One step at a time and you will see huge differences in your life. Buy a pedometer, set a goal and monitor your all physical activities 24/7. Did I mention using stairs instead of elevators will pump more oxygen to your bloodstream? More oxygen means better health and better mental activities. What about starting to watch your diet and eat only healthy fresh food? Combination of physical activity and healthy diet will improve your health dramatically. </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Park a few blocks from work and walk in.</li>
        <li>Ride your bike to work</li>
        <li>Take the stairs</li>
        <li>Walk a few laps around the block on your lunch break.</li>
    </ul>
