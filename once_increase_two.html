    <h1>I will try to get more than 2% today!</h1>
    <p>First, what is your goal for today? We suggest increasing the time spent exercising from 30 minutes to at least 45 minutes. An easy way to do this is to “add on” to what you are already doing. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        If you take a daily walk, try picking up the pace a bit and going two blocks farther before you turn around.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you exercise with a timed class or video, spend 15 minutes stretching or doing low-impact strength-building exercises afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you exercise in several short blocks of time (5 or 10 or 15 minutes each), add another one when you get up in the morning, during your lunch break, or before going to bed.
