    <H1>Start your journey to a better life for one week.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Well, life is short and precious. The good news is just investing 2% of your time a day for physical activities will revamp your health dramatically. Let's set a goal! You already realized the benefits of your baby steps. From this point we are going from baby steps to toddler steps. Once you start your very first steps nothing can stop you going to a better, healthy lifestyle. 

        The goal is to get your two percent, every day, for a week. Of course, you can do this on your own, but reaching this goal with a friend can be that much more enjoyable! Did you know that social exercise activities are a great way to consistently feel motivated to exercise? 
    <ul>
        <li>Go hiking with friends</li>
        <li>Try out a new activity, like ballroom dancing</li>
        <li> Plant a small garden with fresh vegetables to share with friends</li>
        <li> Sign up for a fun, low-stress 5k, like a local color run or charity benefit, and walk briskly or jog to prepare for it</li>
    </ul>
    When you and your friend reach your goal together at the end of the week, do something fun and healthy to reward yourselves! 



    <!--  For example, start a gym membership; find some people to go hiking once a week.  Perhaps consider learning to gardening, healthy cooking and hey, why not learn to dance! Well donâ€™t forget joining  a group is more motivational than doing it by yourself. </p>
  
      <ul>
          <li>Take up dancing</li>
          <li>Go hiking with friends</li>
          <li>Take up gardening</li>
      </ul>
