<H1>Start your journey to a better life for one week.</h1>
<br>
<p>Well,  life is short and precious. The good news is just investing 2% of your time a day for physical activities will revamp your health dramatically. Now set a longer goal for yourself. You already realized the benefits of your baby steps. From this point we are going from baby steps to toddler steps. It is not that hard. Once you start your very first steps nothing can stop you going to a better, healthy lifestyle. For example, start a gym membership; find some people to go hiking once a week.  Perhaps consider learning to gardening, healthy cooking and hey, why not learn to dance! Well donâ€™t forget joining  a group is more motivational than doing it by yourself. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Take up dancing</li>
        <li>Go hiking with friends</li>
        <li>Take up gardening</li>
    </ul>
