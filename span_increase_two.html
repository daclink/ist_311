    <h1>I will get more than 2% for two weeks!</h1>
    <p>You are now realizing the benefits of having your 2% and you also see an opportunity to get a bit more in your schedule. Try it out—for two weeks, turn 2% into 3% (45 minutes daily) or even 4% (1 hour daily). But watch out! You may become addicted!

    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Try adding on a little bit to your existing workout. Walk an extra few blocks, stretch after your workout, or try some strength training.</li>
        <li>This is a great time to try out something new! Always wanted to check out swing dancing, but haven’t gotten around to it? This is your chance!</li>
        <li>Keep track of your progress. At the end of the two weeks, reward yourself! Try out a new healthy restaurant, purchase a small treat (new exercise gear, anyone?), or just make time for a hike with a friend.</li>
    </ul>
