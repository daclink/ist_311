    <h1>Try and get 2% for two weeks</h1>
    <p>Are you satisfied with your strategy designed to encourage you to do the 2% physical activity? Then, you can have another strategy in order to continue to get your two percent. For example, how about offering you 7 points when you maintain your 2% for a week? If you succeed in earning 49 points a month later, you can use them for what you want as a reward. Or, you can request your family or friends to help you getting your 2% by making them give you a reward such as compliment when you gain your 2% for a span of time. Then, you can feel how it is enjoyable to do your 2% physical activity in your daily life. Letâ€™s try it for a span of time to make you enjoy doing exercise during 2% of your day.
